          <h2>Correlations Between Health Risks and Age</h2>
          <p>Using data extacted from the 2014 U.S. Census American Community Survey 1-year estimates, the provided health
            risk factors were examined. In this graph, the percent of people who smoke versus the median age was compared
          by state.   </p>

          <p>The first correlation between these two factors that can be deduced is that the median age of smokers in 
            Northeastern states such as Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Pennslyvania are over the age of 
            40. 
          </p>

          <p>The second correlation that can be deduced is that Southern states have the highest percentage of people who
            smoke compared to the other states surveyed. Furthur analysis is required to investigate the validity of these 
            correlations.
